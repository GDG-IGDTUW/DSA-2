# Student Attendance Management System

## Problem Statement

A school requires a digital system to manage the attendance of students effectively. Your task is to implement a Student Attendance Management System that offers the following functionalities:

1. **Add Student:** Register a new student by capturing their name, roll number, and class.
2. **Mark Attendance:** Record the attendance for a specific student as either Present, Absent, or Late.
3. **View Attendance:** Display the complete attendance record of a specific student.
4. **Remove Student:** Delete a studentâ€™s record permanently from the system.

Handle all edges case appropriately.

Obtain the Boiler Plate code from `boilerplate_code.md` in C++/Java/Python.
